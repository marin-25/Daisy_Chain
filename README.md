# Daisy_Chain
using the function Manipulate[PolarPlot[r = Cos[a*t], {t, 0, 2*Pi}], {a, 0, 10, 1}] users are able to explore various "flowers"                            
                            
                            
                                                     
                            
This project was created for Math 231W here is an excerpt from my  essay explaining and process and inspiration of the pendant.

Project 2: Parametric Daisy Pendent

  Out of a single parametric 3D equation, which has been used to create two different types of flowers and two identical hoops, the flowers lay flat while the single hoop on top has its Y and Z axis functions switched. This switch allows a rotation of the hoop allows the Parametric Daisy sculpture to be a pendant for a necklace. 
    
  The phrase “daisy chaining” has inspired the final sculpture. In terms of computer hardware, daisy-chaining is the act of connecting several devices in a linear series. Moreover, because Mathematica is a programming language, it is interesting to combine concepts that are related to computers as well as math and nature. Therefore, because computer hardware daisy chains are linear, the final pendant is also presented in a linear format. The practicality of a flat pendant is so the design can be viewed on the wearer's neck. This sculpture is not just an object; it is a piece of jewelry. Thus, it is meant to be worn and of course, most importantly, be atheistically pleasing in the way it reflects the complexity of mathematics and nature.
